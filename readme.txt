   Thank you for choosing Address Book XP. This program has been designed
   to manage your phone book and diary appointments. It has been designed
   with the UK in mind as that is my nationality, but it may be altered to suit
   your own preferences.

   Before I continue, credits must be issued to SparQ, whose code inspired me
   and influenced the style of this program. All the code has been re-written for
   Windows XP but some similarities may be spotted.

   If you are using this program without the system fonts i have used then you
   will experience some problems with screen layouts. If you are using WinXP
   Then you should not experience any problems, otherwise, install the fonts
   included in the zip file.

   When you click on a username, a label will display the password for that
   user, this should be set to visible = false as if you use, everyone will
   have access to your password.

   Once again, thank you for downloading my code, I hope you have loads
   of good ideas on how to improve it. If you do improve it, please make some
   acknowlegement to me, as I have done to SparQ above. Please leave some
   comments on my submission.
